Any Section 21 notice served after commencement is legally invalid and cannot be relied on by a landlord to obtain a possession order from the county court. Landlords who wish to regain possession must instead use Section 8 or another lawful ground and follow the full court process.",

Tenants can usually end a periodic tenancy by giving at least two months' written notice at any time, with no minimum term or break clause required, while the existing rent and other terms continue unless lawfully varied.
