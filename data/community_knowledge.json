            "question": "Can my landlord evict me without a reason?",
            "answer": "No. Since the Renters' Rights Act 2025 came into effect, Section 21 'no-fault' evictions have been abolished. Your landlord can only evict you using Section 8 grounds, which require a specific legal reason such as rent arrears (at least 2 months), antisocial behaviour, or the landlord wanting to sell or move into the property. They must follow the correct notice period for each ground.",

            "question": "How much can my landlord increase the rent?",
            "answer": "Your landlord can only increase rent once per year using a Section 13 notice, which must give at least 2 months' notice. The increase must be to the market rate — not punitive or retaliatory. If you believe the proposed increase is above market rate, you can challenge it at the First-tier Tribunal within the notice period. The tribunal will set a fair market rent and can no longer set rent higher than the landlord proposed. Rent review clauses in tenancy agreements cannot override the Section 13 process.",

            "answer": "Your landlord must protect your deposit in a government-approved scheme (DPS, MyDeposits, or TDS) within 30 days of receiving it, and provide you with 'prescribed information' about the scheme. If they fail to do this, you can apply to the county court for compensation of 1x to 3x the deposit amount. Additionally, the landlord may face restrictions on recovering possession until the deposit is properly protected. Keep records of when you paid and any communications about the deposit.",

Under Awaab's Law (extended to private rented sector by the Renters' Rights Act 2025), landlords must respond to hazard reports within 14 days and begin repairs within a further 7 days. For emergencies (no heating, dangerous electrics, sewage), the response must be within 24 hours. Steps: 1) Report in writing with photos. 2) Give reasonable time to respond. 3) Contact your local council's Environmental Health department. 4) Apply to the First-tier Tribunal for a Rent Repayment Order if the landlord still fails to act.",

            "answer": "No — this is an illegal eviction, which is a criminal offence under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. Your landlord cannot lock you out, remove your belongings, cut off utilities, or harass you to leave. If this happens: 1) Call the police (101 or 999 if in danger). 2) Contact your local council's housing team — they have a duty to help with illegal evictions. 3) Contact Shelter (0808 800 4444) for emergency advice. 4) Keep evidence (photos, witness statements, messages). You may be able to get an emergency court injunction to get back into your home. Under the Renters' Rights Act 2025, local authorities can impose civil penalties of up to £35,000 for illegal eviction.",

Under Awaab's Law, landlords must investigate within 14 days of being notified and start repairs within 7 days. Document everything: photograph the mould, note the date, and report in writing. If mould is affecting your health, see your GP and get medical evidence. If your landlord fails to act, contact Environmental Health at your local council. You can also claim compensation through the First-tier Tribunal. Never attempt to resolve a structural damp issue yourself — this is your landlord's legal obligation.",

            "answer": "No. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, unfair terms in tenancy agreements are not enforceable. Common unfair terms include: professional cleaning clauses (requiring specific companies), excessive penalty charges, restrictions on decorating, and terms that override your statutory rights. Under the Renters' Rights Act 2025, tenants have the right to request a pet, and landlords can only refuse on reasonable grounds. Blanket pet bans are no longer enforceable.

They can only enter for specific reasons: inspections, repairs, or viewings (if you're leaving). You have the right to refuse entry if proper notice hasn't been given. In an emergency (gas leak, flooding), the landlord can enter without notice. Repeated unannounced visits may constitute harassment, which is a criminal offence under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.",

They must provide you with a copy of the certificate (CP12) within 28 days of the check and before you move in. If your landlord doesn't have a valid gas safety certificate, this is a criminal offence carrying unlimited fines and up to 6 months imprisonment.

Key mandatory grounds: Ground 1 (landlord or close family member wants to live in the property — 4 months notice), Ground 1A (landlord wants to sell — 4 months notice), Ground 8 (at least 2 months rent arrears at notice and hearing). Key discretionary grounds: Ground 10 (some rent arrears), Ground 12 (breach of tenancy terms), Ground 14 (antisocial behaviour).
